IMBA enterprise is expanding its operations into the banking sector. Their first goal is to build up capital, 
so IMBA enterprises have come up with a plan: to market a financial product that offers an attractive fixed 
term interest rate to people who make a sizable deposit (but which can’t be withdrawn for a year) - the 
“IMBA Platinum Deposit”. 
Cold-calling potential customers to sell this new product is a necessary but difficult and time-consuming 
task. Only a relatively small proportion of individuals who the company contacts will be receptive to their 
marketing, making clear how important it is to identify which people should be targeted. This is the 
business analytics task you must complete for this coursework, and submit in the style of a professional 
business report - as though being delivered directly to the company. 
Luckily, IMBA enterprises have taken over operations of a banking company that offered a very similar 
(i.e. almost identical) product. In fact the “IMBA Platinum Deposit” is essentially just a rebranding of that 
product. And this means they have detailed records of previous marketing calls, all attempting to sell that 
same product that you can use to inform your model building. This prior data includes information about 
the characteristics and demographics of people who were called, as well as some features of the calls 
made themselves. And of course, they also vitally have information as to whether the people contacted 
ultimately subscribed to the product or not. 
This data can shed light on the sort of people who IMBA enterprises should target, and how they should 
go about it. Your task, as a consultant, is to analyse that historical dataset, and generate a model that can 
be used to predict if any new individual is a good or bad prospect for the telemarketers to contact (sadly 
it is just too expensive to blanket contact every prospective customer).

To be more profitable, sellers have attached great importance to understand buyer behaviour 
as a fundamental of marketing. The selling processes for purchasing products in the 
supermarket can be abstracted as the buying decision of groups of customers who have a 
similar need for products. Meanwhile, not only customer groups have different willing and 
buying abilities, but most products market to particular small segmentations. Targeted 
marketing research has made some progress, but what is effectively experiment and how to 
serve a specified group of people is still a severe issue for traditional business analysts. One 
mainstream machine learning testing for retailers for solving this is trading up or down the 
qualities of the commodity price from seasons to seasons, which considered to be an 
inefficient, original, time-consuming and expensive strategy. 

This report aims at analyzing the content of a shopping database with more robust multiply 
methods of 3000 customers purchasing records over a half year (from March 01, 2017, to 
August 31, 2017). After data preprocessing, here we set customers as our minimal analysis 
target running the PCA, LDA and NMF to reduce dimensions and identify the most import 
features in protein segments. We then compared the customer segmentation results of both K-
means and Gaussian Mixture model interpreting the character of each customer, and evaluate 
whether it is useful. In the end, total customers divided into five segmentations with pen 
portraits, like low-income groups and shopaholics. For elements of 3000 customers, we found 
that spend and purchasing quantity of each category have enormous variance. Meanwhile, 
statistical analysis for market segmentation provides some insights for profitability correlates 
with segmentation in selling, and we also offer some useful test hypothesis methods for 
further profound research like segmented A-B test

It is well known that the stock market driven by the psychological and financial factors, as it's a tremendously complex and volatility processing system across the world. With many socioeconomic factors, hidden behaviour and complex models for the stock price, consequently, is hard to predict and evaluate. But such an informationally efficient is also an ethical judgment resource for investors and predictors take those into account and act accordingly with profitable market returns over a long-term, for the stock price tend to reflect all available information fully.

Figure 1: Structure of our research 
APPLE Inc. aimed to do an exploratory analysis of the social networking environments and public mood influence on its stock, like twitter. As behavioural finance emphases, investors behaviours, as a direct factors influence of stock price, is subject to particular emotions and psychological biases. Consequently, in this research, we aimed at exploring the twitters data from April 2, 2016, to June 15, 2016, to predict and understand the factors that shape investors' individual and collective behaviour. 
We establish a model-based sentiment-retrained trackers and large-scale Twitter contents analyzer at short time intervals. Then we applied the resulting of sentiments and word vectors to predict stock values trends, in particular the individual's contribution for daily, with surprising results. We are surprising find that sentiments and words vectors performed well in stock prediction.

LendingClub is a peer to peer lending company based in the United States, which provides the "bridge" between investors and borrowers. Specifically, LendingClub enables borrowers to create [unsecured personal loans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsecured_debt) last for 36 months or 60 months. Investors can search and browse the loan listings on LendingClub website and select loans that they want to invest in based on the information supplied about the borrower, amount of loan, loan grade, loan purpose, etc., and make money from interest. Borrowers are contracted to **pay back** principal and interest **monthly**, but they can also make payment larger than the monthly due amount and terminate the loan period **in advance**. However, not all monthly payments will be made in time and loans will be charged off if they are several months after due (see https://help.lendingclub.com/hc/en-us/articles/216127747 for detail). Therefore, it’s important for LendingClub to evaluate the risk of a loan before it is issued and keep tracking the risk during the process of installment.
